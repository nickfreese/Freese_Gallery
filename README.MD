# nfGallery
### A fast loading, stripped down media gallery extension for Magento 2

The default Fotoroma implementation on Magenot 2 is slow laoding as it requires JS to render the initial image in the correct size and location.

nfGallery allows you to laod the first image along witht he html while the gallery renders in the background.  

It supports adding html, iframes, and badges as well as a JS api to add slides on the fly.
